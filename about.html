    <p>testSchool shootings are a very hot topic right now. It is a very scary thing to experience these shootings can impact student’s and staff’s lives, and also the families of the victims. Already this year 226 victims have died from school shootings and 574 victims have been injured. This is a major issue because nobody should be scared to go to school and get their education and their Guardians nor family members should not have to worry for their child's safety. We as a community are trying to bring awareness to this current issue, that we as America are facing today. By trying to improve security and to have background checks for those who have a license for a gun it will be able to change our world for the better.
